# Srujana TechQuest Competition Project



About
This repository showcases my project presented at the "Srujana TechQuest Competition".  
The project focuses on solving a real-world problem using "embedded systems, sensors, and electronics".  
It reflects my ability to take an idea from concept → design → prototype → demonstration.
